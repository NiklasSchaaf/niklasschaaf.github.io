I'm a Computational Science MSc student at the Universtiy of Amsterdam with a backround in Geoscience.

Arctic background
======
![Sarstangen by Erik Kuschel](/images/Sarstangen.jpg)
I used to live and study on Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic. It is a great place for geology and offers an extraordinary field laboratory for a variety of geological problems. My MSc thesis for example, deals with the tectono-sedimentary evolution of  the Forlandsundet Graben, a transtensional basin on the west coast of Spitsbergen. During my time on Svalbard, I led several field campaigns to remote areas and accompanied field work of other research parties on many occasions.

The experience I gained working under harsh arctic conditions gave me the opportunity to join the MOSAiC drifting expedition. Aboard the icebreaker Polarstern, however, I was not working as a geologist but as a polar bear guard.
