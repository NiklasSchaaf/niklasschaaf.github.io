I recently started my PhD at Kiel University in collaboration with the University of Potsdam focusing on links between tectonics, sedimentation and climate. My study areas include the northwestern and central part of the Himalaya where I will conduct traditional fieldwork complemented by dating techniques, such as CRN and OSL, as well as GIS analyses.

Arctic background

I used to live and study on Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic. It is a great place for geology and offers an extraordinary field laboratory for a variety of geological problems. My MSc thesis for example, deals with the tectono-sedimentary evolution of  the Forlandsundet Graben, a transtensional basin on the west coast of Spitsbergen. During my time on Svalbard, I led several field campaigns to remote areas and accompanied field work of other research parties on many occasions.

The experience I gained working under harsh arctic conditions gave me the opportunity to join the MOSAiC drifting expedition. Aboard the icebreaker Polarstern, however, I was not working as a geologist but as a polar bear guard.
