I recently started my PhD at Kiel University in collaboration with the University of Potsdam focusing on links between tectonics, sedimentation and climate. My study areas include the northwestern and central part of the Himalaya where I will conduct traditional fieldwork complemented by dating techniques, such as CRN and OSL, as well as GIS analyses.

My Arctic background
======
Previously, I lived and studied on Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic. Svalbard is a great place for geology and offers an extraordinary field laboratory for a variety of geological problems. For my MSc thesis for example I worked on the tectono-sedimentary evolution of  the Forlandsundet Graben, a transtensional basin on the west coast of Spitsbergen.
